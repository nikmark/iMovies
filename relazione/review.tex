\section{Review of the External System}

\subsection{Background}

\noindent {\bf Developers of the external system:} {\it x', y', z', ...} \\

\noindent {\bf Date of the review:} ...

\subsection{Completeness in Terms of Functionality} 

Does the system meet the requirements given in the assignment? If not, list any missing functionality.


\subsection{Architecture and Security Concepts}

Study the documentation that came with the external system and
evaluation.
Is the chosen architecture well suited for the tasks specified in the 
requirements?  Is the risk analysis coherent and complete?   Are the
countermeasures appropriate?

\subsection{Implementation}

Investigate the system. Are the countermeasures implemented as described? Do you see security problems?


\subsection{Backdoors}

Describe all backdoors found on the system. 
It may be that you also find unintended backdoors, which cannot be distinguished from intentionally added backdoors.



\subsection{Comparison}

Compare your system with the external system you were given for the
review.   Are there any remarkable highlights in your system or the external system?
